    "## 1.4 Control Structures \n",
    "Control structures are fundamental to programming. They allow a program to decide what actions to perform and when to perform them. In Python, control structures enable decision-making, executing specific blocks of code, and repeating tasks based on conditions.\n",

    "- **Repeat Tasks**: Perform the same task multiple times, either a fixed number of times or until a condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of control structures:\n",
    "1. **Conditional Statements**: Used for decision-making.\n",

    " **1.4.1.1 Indentation in Python**\n",

    "### **1.6.1.1 What is a Decorator?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **decorator** is a function in Python that allows you to modify or enhance another function or class without directly changing its code.\n",
    "- Think of it as a \"wrapper\" that adds extra functionality to an existing function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.6.1.2 Why Use Decorators?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Reusability**: Add functionality to multiple functions without rewriting code.\n",
    "- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep the original logic separate from additional functionality.\n",
    "- **Readable and Maintainable Code**: Apply enhancements in a clean and organized way.\n",

    "---\n",

    "### **1.6.1.3 How Decorators Work**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A decorator takes a function as input, modifies its behavior, and returns the modified function.\n",
    "- You use the `@decorator_name` syntax to apply a decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (Concept):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def decorator(func):\n",

    "2. **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Benefits of OOP**\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Divide a program into smaller parts (classes and objects).\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Reuse existing classes through inheritance.\n",

    "### **1.7.2.1 Class**\n",
    "- A class is a blueprint for objects.\n",
    "- It defines the properties (attributes) and actions (methods) an object can have.\n",

    "### **1.7.2.2 Object**\n",
    "- An object is an instance of a class.\n",

    "---\n",
